# StairAutoJump
Turns on auto jump when in/on stairs!

## Why though?
As of snapshot [16w20a](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Java_Edition_16w20a), auto jump on stairs makes you move faster than just pressing the spacebar. This mod enables it automatically for you when in/on stairs if you don't use auto jump.
