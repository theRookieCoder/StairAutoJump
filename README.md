# StairAutoJump

Turns on auto jump when in/on stairs!

## Why though?

As of snapshot [16w20a](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Java_Edition_16w20a), auto jump on stairs makes you move faster than just pressing the spacebar.
This mod enables it automatically for you when in/on stairs, then disables it once you get off.
